# DeepClean

Python package.


## Inspiration:

I have been working with visual and text data for a while now; while it is super fun to work with different modalities of data, at times you will find yourself learning so many new tools to pre-process or clean that after a while it's gets cumbersome. So, I thought to develop a package that could be used to to pre-process / clean different modalities of data.
